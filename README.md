📋 Updated User Flow Description
1. The Admin Flow
The Admin logs in to a secure dashboard. They have full control over the medical staff. If a new Cardiologist joins the clinic, the Admin uses the "Add Doctor" form to generate their credentials. If a doctor leaves, the Admin clicks "Delete" to remove them from the booking options immediately.
2. The Doctor Flow
The Doctor logs in to check their daily schedule. They see a list of patients along with the AI Risk Analysis. If the doctor has an emergency or cannot make a specific time, they click the "Cancel" button on that appointment. The status updates in the database instantly so the patient knows the appointment is off.
